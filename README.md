# 🤖 KiddosPlay - Early Childhood Learning Hub

**Mini Project for [BCA/Semester 5]**

## 🌟 Project Overview

KiddosPlay is a secure, interactive full-stack web application designed for **early childhood education (Ages 2-5)**. It provides a safe, gamified learning environment for children while demonstrating a robust **tiered security model** required for sensitive child data applications.

## 🧩 Website Navigation & Functional Modules

The core learning activities are structured into five distinct modules, all accessible from the main **Room Area (Home Page)**.

| Functional Module Name | User-Facing Activity | Home Page Location | Learning Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TuneTown** | Music & Rhymes | **Radio** Hotspot | Auditory learning and simple language structure. |
| **LetterBeats** | Phonics & Letters | **Toy Box** Hotspot | Early literacy and sound association. |
| **BrainPlay** | Quiz Section | **Computer** Hotspot | Logic, counting, and general knowledge quizzes. |
| **ColorFun** | Drawing & Coloring | **Whiteboard** Hotspot | Fine motor skills, creativity, and color recognition. |
| **StoryLand** | Interactive Stories | **Bookshelf** Hotspot | Language comprehension and narrative sequencing. |

## 🔐 System Architecture & Tiered Access Control

The project is built around **three distinct user roles** and a mandatory **Admin Approval** gate, ensuring no data is accessible until the parent account is verified. 

### Role Breakdown and Access Flow

| Role | Access Control & Verification | Key Responsibilities & Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Admin** | **Separate Login** (`admin/handle_admin_login.php`) | **System Gatekeeper.** Reviews uploaded **Parent/Child certificates** and manually sets new user accounts to **'approved'** status. Manages overall system health. |
| **2. Parent/Teacher** | **Initial Registration** $\rightarrow$ **Admin Approval Required** $\rightarrow$ **Login** | **Main User.** Manages child profile, provides the **Parental Control Password**, and monitors progress. **Cannot log in until accepted by Admin.** |
| **3. Child/User** | **Access via Parent Login** (after approval) | **Core Learner.** Accesses the 5 Core Modules. The learning environment is **Age-Customized** based on their registered age (e.g., age 3 sections). |

### Advanced Monitoring & Security Features

* **Screen Time Limit:** A hard limit of **30 minutes** of continuous play is enforced.
* **Screen Lock:** Upon hitting the time limit, the current page locks and requires the **Parental Control Password** to unlock, ensuring parental awareness.
* **Progress Calendar:** Parents can view detailed daily activity, including **time spent on each section**, using a calendar interface.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Security

### Technologies Used

| Category | Component |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Backend** | **PHP** (MySQLi/PDO) |
| **Database** | **MySQL** |
| **Frontend** | **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript** |

### Critical Security Measures

* **Credential Protection:** Database connection credentials are secured in a separate **`db_config.php`** file and excluded from this public repository using **`.gitignore`**.
* **SQL Injection Prevention:** All data handling utilizes **Prepared Statements** to prevent database exploits.
* **Authentication:** All administrative and learning pages enforce **session authentication** and **role validation**.
